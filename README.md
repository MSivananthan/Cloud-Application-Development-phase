## Project Overview

This project, developed in collaboration with **Naan Mudhalavan**, aims to create a cloud-native application that leverages cloud computing to deliver a highly available, scalable, and secure service. The application is designed to meet the demands of modern, dynamic workloads by utilizing cloud services and best practices.

## Features

- **Scalability:** Automatic scaling to handle increased load.
- **High Availability:** Redundant and distributed architecture ensures uptime.
- **Security:** Implements industry-standard security practices, including encryption and authentication.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Optimized resource usage to minimize costs.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Automated testing and deployment pipelines.

## Technologies Used

- **Cloud Provider:** AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform
- **Frontend:** React, Angular, or Vue.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Python (Flask/Django), or Java (Spring Boot)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or DynamoDB
- **Containerization:** Docker, Kubernetes
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Jenkins
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0, JWT
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform, AWS CloudFormation

## Architecture

The application is built on a microservices architecture, with each service handling a specific aspect of the application. The services communicate over REST APIs and are orchestrated using Kubernetes.



## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naan-mudhalavan/cloud-application-development.git
   cd cloud-application-development
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install  # For Node.js backend
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following variables:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
   CLOUD_API_KEY=your-cloud-api-key
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start  # For Node.js backend
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can access it via the browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the configured port).

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test  # Or the appropriate test command for your framework
```

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to the cloud using the following steps:

1. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t your-app-name .
   ```

2. **Push the image to a container registry:**
   ```bash
   docker push your-docker-registry/your-app-name
   ```

3. **Deploy using Kubernetes:**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```
